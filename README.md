# SQL-Case-Study-Marketing-Analysis
In this project, I leveraged SQL to analyze marketing data for 'Sustainable Clothing Co.,' a company dedicated to fusing sustainability with style. Our primary focus was to assess the impact of their marketing campaigns. Throughout the project, we unearthed valuable insights from the data, addressed critical questions, and evaluated the effectiveness of their marketing efforts. ðŸš€

This endeavor has significantly enriched my knowledge in advanced SQL concepts, including subqueries, the usage of the HAVING clause, NOT IN operator, various join techniques, and the application of the Rank() function. It also provided me with the opportunity to explore and assess diverse problem-solving approaches, enhancing my analytical skills and SQL proficiency. ðŸŽ¯
